# Development Gameplan

This document outlines the three-phase development approach for the My Lego App project.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

**Estimated Duration: 2-3 weeks**

### Core Infrastructure

1. Project setup

   - Vue.js project initialization
   - Bulma and FontAwesome integration
   - Development environment configuration
   - SQLite database setup
   - Git configuration
     - Initialize repository
     - Set up pre-commit hook for Prettier formatting
     - Set up pre-push hook for code quality checks
     - Configure .gitignore for project

2. Authentication System

   - Google OAuth implementation
   - Session management
   - Basic user profile storage
   - Authentication UI components

3. Basic Layout
   - Navigation structure
   - Responsive layout implementation
   - Common components (header, footer)
   - Toast notification system

### Deliverables

- Functioning authentication flow
- User registration process
- Basic navigation structure
- Database schema implementation
- Development environment documentation

## Phase 2: Core Functionality

**Estimated Duration: 3-4 weeks**

### User Profile, Public Search & Sets

1. Profile management page

   - Screen name editing
   - Rebrickable API key management
   - Rebrickable user token management
   - Basic account settings
   - Profile data validation
   - New user onboarding flow
     - Redirect new users to profile setup before database creation
     - Required fields collection (screen name, etc.)
     - Confirmation button to create account
     - Cancel option that ends OAuth2 session
     - Validation of required fields
     - Clear user feedback on required steps

2. Public search functionality

   - Rebrickable API integration
   - Search interface implementation
   - Results display component
   - Error handling

3. Set Management
   - Set listing functionality
   - Brick management interface
   - Filter should be associated with the search that includes: color, year, category and partlist; a sort feature should be available for relevance, name, year and part count
   - Add/Move/Delete operations
   - Form validation

### Deliverables

- Functional search system
- Set management capabilities
- Basic profile management
- API integration documentation
- Initial user testing feedback

## Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish

**Estimated Duration: 2-3 weeks**

### Advanced Features

1. Account Management

   - Account deletion functionality
   - Data export capabilities
   - Audit logging system
   - Security enhancements

2. User Experience Improvements

   - Advanced error handling
   - Loading states
   - Form validation improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Avatar display improvements:
     - Fallback to colored circle with text when Google avatar fails to load
     - Use first character of screen name (if available) or email
     - Consistent styling with Bulma's color palette
     - Maintain circular shape matching Google avatar format

3. Search Improvements

   - Analyze search usage patterns and user behavior
   - Implement relevance scoring for search results
   - Add fuzzy matching for better error tolerance
   - Optimize search filters for more accurate results
   - Consider implementing search suggestions
   - Add search history and popular searches
   - Improve result ranking based on user interactions
   - Implement caching for frequently searched terms

4. Testing & Documentation
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - User documentation
   - API documentation updates

### Final Polish

1. UI/UX Refinements

   - Animation improvements
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Cross-browser testing

2. Performance
   - Code optimization
   - API call optimization
   - Cache implementation
   - Load time improvements

### Deliverables

- Complete account management features
- Comprehensive test suite
- Full documentation
- Production deployment guide
- Performance metrics
