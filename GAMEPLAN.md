     - Set up pre-commit hook for Prettier formatting
     - Set up pre-push hook for code quality checks
     - Configure .gitignore for project

2. Authentication System

   - Google OAuth implementation
   - Session management
   - Basic user profile storage
   - Authentication UI components

3. Basic Layout
   - Navigation structure
   - Responsive layout implementation
